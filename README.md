# Vision-Based-Precision-Landing-Using-SITL-and-Ground-Pattern-Recognition-in-Gazebo-ROS

The project proposed a Vision-Based precision landing methodology to recharge UAVs wirelessly. 

Extending UAVs operating time help leveraging their potential; thus, powerful military applications such as border security and surveillance made ease.

The AI system allows the drone to land accurately on a Ground Pattern recognition, that can be deployed on charging stations to recharge UAVs wirelessly or even be deployed at any selected location for drone package delivery or retrieval. Therefore, it is a multipurpose system and very scalable.

The system has been tested using Gazebo simulator with Robot Operating System (ROS) to simulate Software in The Loop (SITL), which is a vehicle that has the same capabilities as a real drone, and it uses the Ardupilot firmware that most predominant drone companies use, such as Matternet.
